* impression so far.

last time I try to implement it in Java and use Swing as GUI, it's a
headache. Compiling classes is slow. build GUI in Java Swing is
painful. Binding events in Swing bring even more pain.

Now after I know javascript, DOM and jQuery, HTML+CSS+Javascript+Firefox has
become an excellent environment for GUI development.

HTML + CSS can make most UI controls. They may not display at where you want
or what size you want at first, but it's easy to get the UI going before
worrying about beauty of UI. The default layout is usually good enough when
developing features.

On the backend side, Javascript is very powerful. I have my little script for
testing and unit testing. But I didn't write many test cases this time. It's
more exciting to get the thing working. And when it's working, I don't bother
add tests. TTD is sometimes good, but when you don't have a picture of where
the system is going, writing tests first makes no sense. Some prototyping is
more useful. You don't test-first because prototyping changes too fast. If you
choose test, you are very slow and may fall behind your brain.

Build a system, make most things working, then refactoring it to patterns, add
tests to guard your refactoring.

I still hope there is a better CSS book and there is a better test framework
for Javascript. But the whole thing is good enough even now.  Ah, final word,
I love HTML5.
