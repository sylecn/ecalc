* DONE [BUG L1] refactoring: edit history nS and oS, bind onclick directly
  on <TD>, pass x and y directly to handler function.
  then remove the giant ecalc.clickOnHistory(event) and param fetching.
* DONE [BUG L3] C-c doesn't work as copy when select number/op/result in history
  reason: check updateUI call, updateUI redraw everything (incl. text) you see.
* DONE [BUG L2] in main keydown dispatch,
  ecalc and VM should accept only single char keydown, not with modifiers.
  for example, C-c should not send c to VM or ecalc.
* DONE [BUG L4] history is wrong when a result is used as the start number of
  a new calculation.

  example: NUM1 MULTIPLY NUM3 EQUAL ADD NUM2 EQUAL
  current History:
  2             1
  +             *
                3   3

  should have:
  3             1
  +             *
  2   5         3   3
