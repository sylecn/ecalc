Use Cases

notations:
  I use cal for ecalc.
  [ reg A ] means a drop down list
  [ D1, D2, A ] means a drop down list contains selection D1, D2 and A.

user start cal
cal shows default kbd device and default screen device.

in screen window, user press keys on keyboard
if the key is invalid, do nothing. show msg in console.
if the key is number, all active cal screen shows the number, kbd has an
    animation show what's pressed.
if the key is op, check whether it is valid op for current env.
if it is invalid, warn the user, blink screen and kbd error light.
    show msg in console.
if it is valid, push number to history window, depends on the screen type(cal
    model type).
    if op is +-*/ show op in screen,
    if op is Clear, reset history stack, don't clear history, for undo feature.
        make no numbers and no ops in current cal.
    if op is Backspace, and valid, delete one char of the number.
                        and invalid, do nothing, show msg in console.
    if op is =, invalid, only show in console.
                valid, show result. push the cal to cal stack. clear
                history window. If cal looks similar to previous cal, and
                result match, show a green light bulb in history window.
                result doesn't match, show a red light bulb in history window.
                and show a diff, show the difference in red, matches in gray.

====================

       | current   | last-active | old    |

         ---------                 ------

         old contains all history in current session (after ecalc starts).
         
         
diff: if similar cal is detected, it will be activated automatically. shows
       | current   | last-active |
         1           1
         +           +

         4    17     4    7
         -------     -------

         Only compare the first col of course. Because the second col was
         supposed to be wrong if there is one mismatch in the 1st col.
         if there is more than one error. show all of them in red.

         <x> means show in red color.
